# id3_decision_tree_classifier

In this repository, **ID3 Decision Tree Classifier Based on both Information Gain and Gain Ratio** was written in Python without library functions. It was used to classify **UCI Machine Learning Datasets** [Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame) and [Wine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine).  

Lastly, the effect of attribute and class noise on the trained classifier was explored. Please see [docoumentation](/doc) to learn more.
